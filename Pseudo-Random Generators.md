#Random numbers
The aim was to compare three random generators with power of language R: uniform distribution, linear congruential generator, linear feedback shift register. I used Monte-Carlo method for this. I created functions generating random points witch amount set by parameter of function, counting their amount inside a circle and total, dividing first by second and muiltiplying result by 4.

#Results

1. Uniform: 3.14620; Difference with Pi ≈ 0.0046
2. LCG: 3.16496; Difference with Pi ≈ 0.0233
3. LFSR: 3.12580; Difference with Pi ≈ 0.0157

Compilation took ~9.1 minutes.

#Recreating
To recreate these experiment you should make following steps:

1. Download, install and run R.
2. Download scripts with functions.
3.
