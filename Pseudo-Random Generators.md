#Random numbers
The aim was to compare three random generators with power of language R: uniform distribution, linear congruential generator, linear feedback shift register. I used Monte-Carlo method for this. I created functions generating random points witch amount set by parameter of function, counting their amount inside a circle and total, dividing first by second and muiltiplying result by 4.

#Results

Uniform - 3.14620

Difference with Pi ≈ 0.0046

LCG - 3.16496

Difference with Pi ≈ 0.0233

LFSR - 3.12580

Difference with Pi ≈ 0.0157

Compilation took ~9.1 minutes.
